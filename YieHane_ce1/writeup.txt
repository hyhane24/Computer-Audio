// I had trouble finding the audio file readable by Beads so there are couple of audio files in /data as a result of trial and error
// The one I used was pho.wav, which thankfully worked!

If you use a custom UGen (Unit Generator) for your exercise, describe it below:


I used Biquad Filter, as taught during lecture, as a custom UGen for this assignment. 
The frequency of the .wav sound gets filtered through the UI control. 
Uncomment the .setNumberOfTickMarks (line 58) to see margins by 5 on the slider (just a customization :) )
Move around the slider control to test the sounds. 


Thank you!
