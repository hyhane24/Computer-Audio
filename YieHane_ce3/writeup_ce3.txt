CE 3 WriteUp

I used BiquadFilter (duckFilter) for ducking the background sound, just as taught in class. 
The background sound is ducked when voice 1 or 2 play buttons are pressed. 
Then it resumes back on looping after the voice playing ends. 

** Error Note 

As you can see in my /data/ folder, you can see that there are 2 .wav files. 
These are two of my voice recordings as instructed. 

However, when I compiled

voice1 = getSamplePlayer("voice_1.wav");
voice2 = getSamplePlayer("voice_2.wav");

Errors occurred and the sketch itself could not be compiled. 

In order to have the sketch at least compiled to show functionality, I had 

voice1 = getSamplePlayer("pho.wav");
voice2 = getSamplePlayer("pho.wav");

As dummy data. The file "pho.wav" is what I used for CE1, a .wav file that Beads could compile. 
This is NOT my recording, it is from sound source. I thought I should make a note. 

With this input, the sketch works. All the music loops, button plays, and sliders all work. 
But when either pressing Voice1 or Voice2 buttons, another music will play instead of my voice. 

pho.wav was used for both Voice1 and Voice2 placeholders so when looking at if Voice1 stops when playing Voice2, please listen closely. 

Thank you and I apologize for the inconvenience. I tried exporting the voice.wav files multiple times but could not figure it out. 

If a feedback comment for resolving this problem could be given, I would truly appreciate it. 


Thank you again :)
